## üõ† Technical Implementation

### **1. AI Task API Service (`lib/ai-task-api.ts`)**

**Core Operations:**
```typescript
export class AITaskAPIService {
  // Full CRUD operations
  async executeOperation(operation: TaskOperation, parameters: any): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  
  // Specific operations
  private async createTask(params: any): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async readTask(taskId: string): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async updateTask(taskId: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async deleteTask(taskId: string): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async listTasks(filter?: TaskFilter): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async searchTasks(query: string, filter?: TaskFilter): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async completeTask(taskId: string): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async setPriority(taskId: string, priority: Priority): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async rescheduleTask(taskId: string, dueDate: Date | null): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async batchUpdate(operations: BatchTaskOperation[]): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
  private async bulkDelete(criteria: TaskFilter | string[]): Promise<AITaskOperationResult>
}
```

**Advanced Filtering:**
```typescript
export interface TaskFilter {
  status?: 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done'
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  completed?: boolean
  dueBefore?: Date
  dueAfter?: Date
  title?: string
  description?: string
  tags?: string[]
  createdBefore?: Date
  createdAfter?: Date
  limit?: number
  offset?: number
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Processing (`lib/ai-task-service.ts`)**

**Comprehensive Command Processing:**
```typescript
export async function processAITaskCommand(
  userId: string,
  userMessage: string,
  aiResponse: string,
  realTimeContext?: AIRealTimeContext
): Promise<TaskCreationResult> {
  // Detects and processes:
  // - Direct commands (create, update, delete, etc.)
  // - AI response operations
  // - Advanced commands (list, search, complete, prioritize, reschedule)
  // - Batch operations
  // - Natural language parsing
}
```

**Command Parsing:**
```typescript
export function parseTaskCommand(command: string): {
  operation: TaskOperation
  parameters: Record<string, any>
} | null {
  // Parses natural language into structured operations
  // Supports all CRUD operations and advanced commands
}
```

### **3. Enhanced AI Prompting (`lib/ai-context-provider.ts`)**

**Comprehensive Instructions:**
```typescript
export function createTaskPrompt(
  userMessage: string,
  enhancedContext: EnhancedUserContext
): string {
  // Provides AI with:
  // - Full operation capabilities overview
  // - Current date/time context
  // - Comprehensive examples for all operations
  // - Clear behavioral guidelines
  // - Permission for unrestricted access
}
```

### **4. Chat Integration (`components/CleanAIChat.tsx`)**

**Enhanced Processing:**
```typescript
// Process AI response for comprehensive task operations
const taskResult = await processAITaskCommand(
  userContext.user_id,
  userQuestion,
  data.response,
  enhancedContext.realTime
)

if (taskResult.success && taskResult.task) {
  // Handle task creation confirmations
  // Update UI with visual indicators
  // Emit events for cross-component updates
}
```
